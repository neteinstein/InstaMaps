/**
 * Deletes the APK `DownloadAppUpdateUseCase` downloaded to `context.cacheDir` once InstaMaps
 * finishes being updated through it, so it doesn't sit there wasting space indefinitely.
 *
 * Listens for [Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED] specifically: it's one of the few broadcasts
 * exempted from Android 8+'s implicit-broadcast background restrictions (delivered only to the
 * app that was just updated, and only via a manifest-declared receiver like this one - a
 * dynamically registered one wouldn't survive the process being killed during install, which is
 * the common case), making it the only reliable signal for "the update this app itself downloaded
 * just finished installing". Deleting the file any earlier - e.g. right after firing the install
 * `Intent` in `AppUpdateInstaller.installPackage` - would be unsafe, since the system Package
 * Installer may still be reading it via the `FileProvider` `content://` URI at that point.
 *
 * [KoinComponent]/[inject] rather than constructor injection, mirroring
 * `feature:share`'s `ProcessSharedUrlWorker`: this class is instantiated by the system from the
 * manifest (see `app`'s `AndroidManifest.xml`), not by Koin itself, and Koin is guaranteed already
 * started (`InstaMapsApplication.onCreate` always runs before any manifest component can receive a
 * broadcast in this process). [BroadcastReceiver.onReceive] isn't a suspend function and has a
 * short execution budget, so the actual cleanup runs on a [goAsync]-backed coroutine instead of
 * blocking it directly.
