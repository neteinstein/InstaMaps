/**
 * Compares two dot-separated numeric version strings (e.g. `"1.0.16"`) by their numeric segments,
 * NOT lexicographically - a plain string comparison would wrongly rank `"1.0.9"` above `"1.0.16"`
 * (comparing the third segment's leading character, `'9' > '1'`) even though 16 > 9. A missing
 * trailing segment is treated as `0` (so `"1.0"` == `"1.0.0"`), and a non-numeric segment is
 * treated as `0` rather than throwing, so an unexpected tag format degrades to "not newer" instead
 * of crashing the update check.
 *
 * Matches this project's own `versionName` scheme (`"1.0.<CI run number>"` - see
 * `app/build.gradle.kts`/`.github/workflows/release.yml`), but doesn't assume exactly three
 * segments - any dot-separated numeric sequence compares correctly. Callers are expected to strip
 * any leading `"v"` from a GitHub release tag first (see [AppUpdate.versionName]) - this function
 * only ever compares the numeric parts.
